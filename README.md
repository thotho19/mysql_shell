# Chapter 1 MySQL Shell Features
## Supported Languages <br>
MySQL Shell processes code written in JavaScript, Python and SQL. Any executed code is processed as one of these languages, based on the language that is currently active. <br>
## Interactive Code Execution <br>
Unicode text input is supported if the terminal in use supports it. Color terminals are supported. <br>
## Supported APIs <br>
The **AdminAPI** enables you to administer MySQL instances, using them to create InnoDB Clusters <br>
The **X DevAPI** enables developers to work with both relational and document data when MySQL Shell is connected to a MySQL server using the X Protocol.
## Utilities <br>
MySQL Shell includes the following utilities for working with MySQL:

1. An upgrade checker utility to verify whether MySQL server instances are ready for upgrade. Use ```util.checkForServerUpgrade()``` to access the upgrade checker.

2. A JSON import utility to import JSON documents to a MySQL Server collection or table. Use ```util.importJSON()``` to access the import utility.

3. A parallel table import utility that splits up a single data file and uses multiple threads to load the chunks into a MySQL table.

## Output Formats <br>
MySQL Shell can return results in table, tabbed, or vertical format, or as JSON output. [5.7 Output Formats](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-output-formats.html) <br>
